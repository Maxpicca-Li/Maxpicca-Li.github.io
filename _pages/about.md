Currently I am a Master Student at Institute of Computing Technology in University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, advised by Prof. [Yungang Bao](https://acs.ict.ac.cn/english/people_acs_en/researcher_acs_en/202209/t20220927_46107.html).

I got my Bachelor degree from Chongqing University of Computer Science and Technology in 2023.

I am generally interested in micro-architecture design and optimization, with a recent focus on hardware prefetch. My group works on XiangShan processor, a high-performance open-source RISC-V processor. I am currently involved in the LSU design of Xiangshan gen3(Kunminghu).
